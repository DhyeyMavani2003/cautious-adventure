      Built & integrated an end-to-end Rust-based low-latency inference engine for PyTorch under Data & AI Platforms org - while pioneering the efforts to transition the tech stack from Java to Rust.

      In production machines, my work was being actively used to serve 5+ business use-cases leading to P99 inference latency reduction from 4 ms to 2 ms, and P99 tail data ingestion latency reduction from 70 ms to 7 ms. This also increased throughput by 4x, leading to GPU savings of ~ $1 million in the case of PyTorch EBR kNN with custom-filtering model that I got to develop.

      Also, I got to pitch 3 novel product ideas to the CEO, Ryan Roslansky, and that led to further discussions with Product Leaders (VPs, Sr. Directors, Directors, Principal PMs) across 3 business units for formulating them in detail & to potentially incorporate 2 them in the future B2B2C strategies at LinkedIn.
