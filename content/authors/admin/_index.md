      Built & integrated an end-to-end Rust-based low-latency inference engine for PyTorch under Data & AI Platforms org - while pioneering the efforts to transition the tech stack from Java to Rust.

      In production machines, my work was being actively used to serve 5+ business use-cases leading to P99 inference latency reduction from 4 ms to 2 ms, and P99 tail data ingestion latency reduction from 70 ms to 7 ms. This also increased throughput by 4x, leading to GPU savings of ~ $1 million in the case of PyTorch EBR kNN with custom-filtering model that I got to develop.

      Also, I got to pitch 3 novel product ideas to the CEO, Ryan Roslansky, and that led to further discussions with Product Leaders (VPs, Sr. Directors, Directors, Principal PMs) across 3 business units for formulating them in detail & to potentially incorporate 2 them in the future B2B2C strategies at LinkedIn.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
